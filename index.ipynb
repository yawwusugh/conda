    "Code repository for the SIGSPATIAL 2019 paper [REGAL: A Regionalization framework for school boundaries](http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3347146.3359377)\n",

    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is written in Python3.6 and the experiments were run on a machine using Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS. You can follow the commands below for setting up your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up virtual environment\n",
    "Assuming you have Python3, set up a virtual environment\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install virtualenv\n",
    "virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 ./venv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activate the environment\n",
    "Always make sure to activate it before running any python script of this project\n",
    "```\n",
    "source ./venv/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Package installation\n",
    "Install the required packages contained in the file requirements.txt. This is a one-time thing, make sure the virtual environment is activated before performing this step.\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that some geospatial packages in Python require dependencies like [GDAL](https://gdal.org/) to be already installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Navigate to the 'src' folder containing the source scripts\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd ./src\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Run the code\n",
    "You can run the simulations with the following three local search techniques.\n",
    "SHC: Stochastic Hill Climbing\n",
    " SA: Simulated Annealing\n",
    " TS: Tabu Search\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run all the experiments using the following command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "make REGAL\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "OR\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First, make the executable file system readable\n",

    "### Data\n",
    "The geospatial data used here is of [LCPS](https://www.lcps.org/) school district for the school year 2019-20. The data has been pre-processed for usage and may not accurately represent the policies/figures of LCPS.\n",
